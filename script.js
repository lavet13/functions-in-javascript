// The call and apply Methods

// we cannot use arrow function by using call or apply methods, it simply assign the "this" keyword to the window object
const book = function (flightNum, name) {
  console.log(this); // initially the "this" keyword is undefined(in strict mode)

  console.log(
    `${name} booked a seat on ${this.airline} flight ${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`
  );
  this.bookings.push({ flight: `${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`, name }); // enhancement btw "name" - is gonna be the same exact name of the property as the variable name
};

const lufthansa = {
  airline: 'Lufthansa',
  iataCode: 'LH',
  bookings: [],
  // book: function () {},
};

book.call(lufthansa, 239, 'Ivan Skinder');
book.call(lufthansa, 635, 'Pavel Skinder');
// const book = lufthansa.book; // function value

const eurowings = {
  airline: 'Eurowings',
  iataCode: 'EW',
  bookings: [],
};

// Does not work with the "this" properly, so we might to set the "this" keyword manually by using bind method to the function itself
// book(23, 'Sarah Williams');

// Call Method
// this method calls the function with a given "this" value and arguments provided individually;
book.call(eurowings, 23, 'Sarah Williams'); // function is really just an object and objects have methods, therefore functions can have methods too, and the "call" method is one of them, the first argument is exactly what we want the this keyword to point to.
book.call(lufthansa, 228, 'Mary Cooper');

console.log(lufthansa);
console.log(eurowings);

const swiss = {
  airline: 'Swiss Air Lines',
  iataCode: 'LX',
  bookings: [],
};

book.call(swiss, 583, 'Mary Cooper');

// Apply Method
// this method calls the specified function with a given "this" value and arguments provided as an array;
const flightData = [583, 'George Cooper'];
book.apply(swiss, flightData); // this apply method is not that used anymore in modern JavaScript

// we can do the exact same thing, so jonas prefer to use call method and then spread operator out the arguments from an array like this
book.call(swiss, ...flightData);
console.log(swiss);

// so in summary: we now have yet another tool in our toolbox here, and this one is one that allows us to explicitly define the this keyword in any function that we want, but there is actually yet another method which allows us to do the same thing and that's the bind method, it's more important than the call and apply methods;

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Bind Method
// bind allows us to set manually the this keyword for any function call, but it doesn't immediately call the function, instead it returns a new function where the this keyword is bound;
// book.call(eurowings, 23, "Sarah Williams");

const bookEW = book.bind(eurowings); // it won't call the book function, instead it will return a new function, where the "this" keyword will always be set to Eurowings in this case
const bookLH = book.bind(lufthansa); // similar, but with the "this" keyword would be lufthansa
const bookLX = book.bind(swiss); // similar, but with the "this" keyword would be swiss

bookEW(23, 'Steven Williams');

// this bookEW23 function now only needs the name, because the number was already preset here in the bind method;
const bookEW23 = book.bind(eurowings, 23); // so this allows us to set in stone, certain arguments and so this function, the resulting function, then becomes even simpler, so all we have(need) to pass in is the passenger name, and then everything else basically happens automatically; and by the way what we did here, so basically specifying parts of the argument beforehand is actually a common pattern called partial application, so essentially, partial application means that a part of the arguments of the original function are already applied, so which means, already set, and so that's exactly what the bookEW23 function is, it's essentially the book function but with 23 already predefined and the "this" keyword with the value of eurowings;

bookEW23('Jonas Schmedtmann');
bookEW23('Martha Cooper');

// With Event Listener
lufthansa.planes = 300;
lufthansa.buyPlane = function () {
  console.log(this); // initially it points to lufthansa because the object(lufthansa) is calling the method(buyPlane)

  this.planes++;
  console.log(this.planes);
};

// document.querySelector('.buy').addEventListener('click', lufthansa.buyPlane); // we learned that in an event handler function, the "this" keyword always points to the element on which that handler is attached to, but right now it's not our purpose;

document
  .querySelector('.buy')
  .addEventListener('click', lufthansa.buyPlane.bind(lufthansa)); // SOLVE so what we really want to is to manually define the "this" keyword, so we need to pass in a function and not to call it, and so we already know that the "call" method calls the function and so that's not what we need, and so therefore we use bind because we know that the bind is gonna return a new function with the "this" predefined value which is gonna be lufthansa object because we specified that lulw, arguments are optional;

// Partial Application(which means is that we can preset parameters)
// many times we are not even interested in the "this" keyword, but we still use the bind method just to predefine the arguments;

const addTax = (rate, value) => value + value * rate;

console.log(addTax(0.1, 100)); // 10%, result is 110

const addVAT = addTax.bind(null, 0.23); // the "this" keyword set to null and rate(in case order of our arguments) is set to 0.23;
// const addTax = value => value + value * 0.23; // similar as above

console.log(addVAT(200)); // need to keep in mind that order of the arguments then is important, when we are using the bind method onto addTax
console.log(addVAT(23));

// Challenge
const addVATRate =
  (rate = 0.23) =>
  value =>
    value + value * rate;

const addVAT2 = addVATRate(); // default value of rate is 0.23
console.log(addVAT2(200)); // 246
console.log(addVAT2(23)); // 28.29

// SOLVE is the same as above, but this is obviosly unnecessary
// const addTaxRate = rate => value => value + value * rate;

// const addTAXValue = addTaxRate(0.1);
// console.log(addTAXValue(100)); // 110

// so big advantage of callback functions is that it makes it easy to split up our code into more reusable and interconnected parts, where all the functionality is nicely split up into their own functions and that itself is really helpful, but there is a second and way more important advantage which is the fact that callback functions allow us to create abstraction, so basically what abstraction means is that we hide the detail of some code implementation because we don't really care about all that detail, and this allows us to think about problems at a higher more abstract level, the transformer function is really only concerned with transforming the input string itself. But no matter how that transforming itself actually works. So it's basically delegating the string transformation to the other lower level of functions, which are these two.

// First-Class and Higher-Order Functions
// first-class functions is just a feature, that a programming language either has or does not have, All it means is that all functions are values, there are no first-class functions in practice, it's just a concept, there are however higher order functions in practice, which are possible because the language supports first-class functions. So it's a subtle difference.
